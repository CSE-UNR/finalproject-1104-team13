Hi grader,
My partner chase and I did not realize that the project had been changed and so we continued working on the connect 4 project. We actually were doing very well and I have no doubt that if either of us had known that the change had been made, our result would have been significantly better. For what we have, we did well I think, considering we only had a little over 36hrs to complete the project. Please go as easy as you can, it's been a long semester.
